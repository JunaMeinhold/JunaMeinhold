## Hey there! 😺

I'm Juna (she/her, 21), a coder from  
Germany. I mainly code in C#, C++, and C. If you don't see me  
coding, then usually I'm playing games like Skyrim or Fallout 4 🎮,  
or just reading manga or manhwa 📚. I'm almost always free to  
chat, so feel free to message me on Discord (.juna, <a href="https://discord.gg/uZFuRfsPew">or my discord</a>) and use the  
keyword ":3" (cuz bots 🤖).

I'm working on a very big project, and I would appreciate if someone  
could help me, because the game engine I'm working on is a big deal  
and needs tons of care 👩‍💻. Feel free to ask me. I also have a few  
side projects, like my C/COM interop Code Generator 🚀. So, if  
you're interested, you know the deal. You can also ask me for code  
reviews and help with learning coding.

If you just want to chat about some things, have problems, or even  
untreated traumas and you just want to talk, I'm all ears 👂 and  
want to help. I've had and still have my own struggles, but this  
might not be the right place to discuss them.

If you want to build a friendship 🤝, be prepared for my messy  
lifestyle and the challenges that I bring with me. Seriously, I have  
many problems like overthinking and unclear communication sometimes.  
I have a unique personality – I can be dominant in some  
conversations and then normal in others; it always depends on the  
topic. I love helping others, and sometimes I just listen without  
saying a word or offer empathy to those who need it ❤️.
